### About Pages Format

This FE template uses the [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) under the hood for routing. There is a `pages` directory inside the `src` folder that specifies the site structure. Its layout is inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)'s approach of mapping the file system to the website's different pages (and nested pages). The template comes with a demonstration that showcases how page-essential files are organized to mimic said approach.

### Additional Libraries
1. [tailwind-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-styled-components)
2. [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
